::::::::                        THE ADVENTURE OF THE DANCING MEN::::                               Arthur Conan Doyle::::::::     Holmes had been seated for some hours in silence with his long, thin::     back curved over a chemical vessel in which he was brewing a::     particularly malodorous product. His head was sunk upon his breast,::     and he looked from my point of view like a strange, lank bird, with::     dull grey plumage and a black top-knot.::::     "So, Watson," said he, suddenly, "you do not propose to invest in::     South African securities?"::::     I gave a start of astonishment. Accustomed as I was to Holmes's::     curious faculties, this sudden intrusion into my most intimate::     thoughts was utterly inexplicable.::::     "How on earth do you know that?"

If, after doing so, one simply knocks out all the central::     inferences and presents one's audience with the starting-point and::     the conclusion, one may produce a startling, though possibly a::     meretricious, effect. Now, it was not really difficult, by an::     inspection of the groove between your left forefinger and thumb, to::     feel sure that you did not propose to invest your small capital in::     the goldfields."::::     "I see no connection."::::     "Very likely not; but I can quickly show you a close connection. Here::     are the missing links of the very simple chain
